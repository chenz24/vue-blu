# Attention
I'm very sorry about the lack of concern about this library Recently. So busy in doing other things and I have no time to  maintain it. I will be back in 2 about months. Thanks everyone!(20170526)
Thanks to Chenz, because of his oblivion to vue-blu project. We generated new version of vue-blu

近期其他事过于繁忙，以致没时间维护这个库了。很抱歉，不能更新和回答大家的问题。我会在大约两个月后回来继续更新维护它。谢谢大家的支持！(20170526)
